## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- MediaQuery
- JavaSrcipt 

### What I learned

While doing this challenge I have learnt to build logics for multiple functionality such toggling effect(dark/light theme), adding elements in HTML markup, filtering items and most importantly simultaneously  managing all these functionalities. 


### Continued development

This is an app which on refresh backs to its initial state. Further, I'll make this app to be used by multiple users adding the login details functionality and storing their data to prevent webpage going back to initial state.
