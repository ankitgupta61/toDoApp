## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaSrcipt Event Listener

### What I learned

While doing this project I have implemented the Javascript functionality of event Listener. Project helped to polish my css skills as well as JavaScript skills to render something which was running in my mind for nesting comments. I have learnt to implement HTML,CSS,JavaScript to meet design expectation.


### Continued development

This is the nestedCommentSection which on refresh backs to its initial state. Further, I'll make this to sustain it by providing login system.
